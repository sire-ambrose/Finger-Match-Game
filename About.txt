Finger-Match-Game 
At the beginning of the game , 
you pick a number between 1 to 10 and CPU also pick a number between 1 to 10
p= your selected number , c= CPU selected number
Then you and CPU places fingers on the table , 
pf = your number of fingers placed on the table
cf = CPU number of fingers placed on the table
the total number of fingers placed on the table(s) is gotten.
s = pf + cf.
If the total number of fingers (s) is the same with your initial choosen number (p) 
then you win
that is , s = p.
If the total number of fingers (s) is the same with CPU initial choosen number (c) 
then CPU wins
that is , s = c.
The process is repeated until a winner is gotten
that is , until s=p or s=c.
Enjoy!
